                <p>Black holes are an extremely rare phenomenom. Their mass is extremely big so, according to gravitational formulas (Force=g*mass),
                    their gravity is also extremely high. So to sum up, a black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing,
                    including light, has enough energy to escape it. How black holes are born is still not very clear, but the theory of general relativity
                    states that a sufficiently big mass within a sufficiently small space could form a blackhole. This could be possible since Albert Einstein
                    proposed that masses deformed the spacetime. So according to this, a sufficiently big mass can curve space and affect how we perceive
                    time.
                </p>
                <h2>How can we see blackholes?</h2>
                <p>So we have stated that not even light can escape black holes. In fact, nothing can once it has crossed the event horizon or the "limit
                    of no return". Once something goes past this point, the gravity is so strong that not even light can escape it. So with this clear you
                    may be wondering, how can we see black holes if not even light can escape from them? So that's a very logical question. In fact, we actually
                    can't see black holes. That's why they are called black holes, because they are black. We aknowledge their pressence thanks to the 
                    deformation of space they cause around them. Light and other objects such as stars just start to curve when passing nearby a black hole.
                    Black holes also expell radiation, which many times is visible due to the extremely high temperatures, and create visible rings of
                    orbitting photons and other particles which can also reveal the pressence of a black hole.
                </p>

                <h2>Parts of a black hole</h2>
                <p>So a black hole has several parts.<br>The first one is the <b>acretion disc</b>. This isa disc of superheated gas and dust that
                    whirls around a black hole at extreme speeds producing electromagnetic radiation that reveal the black hole's location, as we've
                    already mentioned. The next element is the <b>innermost stable orbit</b> which is basically the inner edge of the acretion disc,
                    and is also the last point in which matter can orbit the black hole wothout falling past the point of no return. We can also find
                    the <b>relativistic jets</b>. Basically, when a black hole absorbs matter such as stars or other objects it expells jets of particles 
                    and blasts out radiation out from the black hole's poles at near light speed. This jets can extend for thousands of light-years into space.
                    Going deeper into the black hole we find the <b>photon sphere</b>. This sphere is created by photons generated by other phenomenoms
                    of the black hole such as relativistic jets. Gravity just outside the event horizon is strong enough to bend photons' paths so we see
                    a bright ring surrounding a circular black shadow. Next up is the <b>event horizon</b>. As we have already explained, the event horizon
                    is the radius where matter and energy cannot escape the black hole's gravity, the point of no return. Reaching the center of the black
                    hole we find the <b>singularity</b>. At this point at the core of the black hole, matter has colapsed into a region of near infinite density
                    called singularity. All the matter and energy that fall into the black hole end up here.
                </p>
                <p> There are supermassive black holes at the center of some galaxies such as our galaxy, the Milky Way. The black hole
                    at the center aof our galaxy is called Sagittarius A.</p>
                <p>Black holes are extremely rare and still unknown phenomenoms. Science is far from near to understanding them. There are still many questions
                    that we cannot answer yet. What would happen if you fell into a black hole? Would time stop due to the near infinite gravity in the core 
                    of a black hole? What happens to the matter that is swallowed by the black hole? With our current technology we just can observe their
                    behaviour in space.
